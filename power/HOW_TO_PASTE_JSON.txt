HOW TO PASTE JSON CODE INTO POWER AUTOMATE ACTIONS
====================================================================

YES! You can paste JSON to configure all fields at once!

METHOD 1: PASTE INTO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS (Easiest)
====================================================================

For EACH action you added:

1. Click on the action (e.g., "Create Action Item Task")
2. Click the "..." menu (three dots) in the top right of the action
3. Select "Peek code"
4. You'll see a code view panel appear
5. DELETE everything in that panel
6. COPY the JSON for that action from ACTION_JSON_SNIPPETS.json
7. PASTE it into the code view panel
8. Click "Done" or close the panel
9. The action fields will auto-populate!

Repeat for all 4 actions.

====================================================================
WHICH JSON TO USE FOR EACH ACTION
====================================================================

Action 1: "Create Action Item Task"
→ Copy: ACTION_1_Create_Action_Item_Task

Action 2: "Set Task Priority"
→ Copy: ACTION_2_Set_Task_Priority

Action 3: "Create Missing Info Task"
→ Copy: ACTION_3_Create_Missing_Info_Task

Action 4: "Set Missing Info Priority"
→ Copy: ACTION_4_Set_Missing_Info_Priority

====================================================================
METHOD 2: PASTE ENTIRE FLOW JSON (Advanced)
====================================================================

If you want to paste the ENTIRE flow definition:

1. Click anywhere OUTSIDE the actions (on the canvas)
2. Click "Peek code" from the flow menu
3. You'll see the ENTIRE flow JSON
4. Find the "actions" section
5. Replace your loop actions with the ones from the package

(This is more complex - Method 1 is easier!)

====================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
====================================================================

- The JSON in ACTION_JSON_SNIPPETS.json uses these loop names:
  • "Apply_to_each" (for Action Items)
  • "Apply_to_each_2" (for Missing Information)

- If your loops have DIFFERENT names, you need to:
  1. Replace "Apply_to_each" with your first loop name
  2. Replace "Apply_to_each_2" with your second loop name

- The action names in "runAfter" and body() must match YOUR action names:
  • "Create_Action_Item_Task"
  • "Create_Missing_Info_Task"

====================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
====================================================================

Can't find "Peek code"?
→ Make sure you're clicking the "..." menu on the ACTION itself, not the loop

Action disappears after pasting?
→ The JSON might have an error. Undo (Ctrl+Z) and check the format

Fields still empty?
→ Try clicking "Done" on the peek code panel to save changes

Connection errors?
→ Make sure your Planner connection is set up first

====================================================================
QUICKEST METHOD - JUST IMPORT THE ZIP!
====================================================================

Honestly, the FASTEST way is still:

1. Power Automate → Import → Import Package (Legacy)
2. Upload: ScopeMapperFlow_FIXED.zip
3. Done - all actions pre-configured!

But if you want to use JSON paste, the snippets are ready in:
ACTION_JSON_SNIPPETS.json
